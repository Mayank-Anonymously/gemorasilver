					who embraces elegance with confidence. Every piece is a blend of
					timeless luxury and youthful flair, handcrafted to celebrate your bold
					spirit, your beauty, and your story. Whether you're dressing up for a
					moment or making everyday moments feel special, Luniva is your silver
					signature. Our vision is to provide you quality, authenticity, and
					effortless style, and Luniva is where desi hearts meet global shine.
					Rooted in the heart of <b>Agra – the City of the Taj</b>, our brand is

					hand.

				<h1>Meet Our Founders</h1>
				<h4>The Story Begins with Friendship</h4>
				<p>
					Muskan Garg and Akanksha Bhardwaj were best friends long before they
					became business partners. With a shared passion for meaningful design
					and a vision to empower women, they co-founded Luniva—a jewellery
					brand that blends elegance with intention. Muskan brings thoughtful
					leadership and a structured approach to the brand’s growth, while
					Akanksha leads with creativity and a deep understanding of what
					resonates with modern women.
				</p>
				<p>
					Together, they have built Luniva not just as a brand, but as a
					celebration of strength, individuality, and friendship.
